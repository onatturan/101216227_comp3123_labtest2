# Weather App 🌦️

This is a simple React-based weather application that allows users to search for the current weather conditions of any city. It fetches real-time data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays key weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

The app uses React features like `useState`, `useEffect`, and props for dynamic functionality and API integration.
